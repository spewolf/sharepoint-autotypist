# FSRC Autofill Tool
## Created by Spencer Wolf

The purpose of this tool is to assist resident advisors at Bowling Green State University with the task of entering data about residents into sharepoint. This is the most time consuming part of the resident advisor job. Many aspects can be automated such as entering a users information, which is numerous, as well as the week number and place of residence.

This tool is still under active development and will hopefully be demo'ed to the Office of Residence Life close to the end of 2019. In it's current state it is currently in active use and is very beneficial. The main issues are with ease of use as well as reusability. However it shows much promise. In personal use this tool has cut down on time spent entering this data by roughly 75%. So a 40 minute session of data entry now takes about 10 minutes. This can be improved in future versions by autosuggesting entries.

**NOTE: This version does not include real data in the residents.csv file in order to maintain the privacy of students**
